an excitable and oscillatory neuron.

implemented in SNNAP (http://snnap.uth.tmc.edu).

The minimal cell model (MCM) is a reduced Hodgkin-Huxley model that can
exhibit excitable and oscillatory behavior. It consists of two
ordinary differential equations, dV/dt for membrane voltage and dW/dt
for potassium activation and sodium inactivation. The MCM has a stable
membrane potential of -60mV. With constant input current of 10uA/cm2, it
exhibits oscillations of 150Hz. It is based on the work by FitzHugh and
Rinzel.

To run:

Download and unzip the zip file into a directory that has no spaces in its path.

Double click on the SNNAP8.jar file (where the 8 might be a different version)

Click on start simulation, then File--> Load simulation and browse to the MCM folder and
select the MCM.smu file.

Finally click on start.
